# tellstones
This is my own attempt at coding a virtual version of Riot Game's new game, Tellstones. This is in no way monetized and is purely for my own coding practice.

## TELLSTONES 
is a game of wit, cunning, and most importantly, memory. Can you trick your opponent to victory?

This script is written in Python 3 and runs in a window managed by tkinter.


## THE COMMANDS:
You can do the following actions on your turn:

- `Place` a stone from the pool onto the line, to the left or right of the current stones in play
- `Hide` a face-up stone that is on the line by turning it face-down.
- `Swap` two stones around.
- `Peek` at a stone that is currently hidden. If your opponent scored 3 points last turn, you get to peek at up to 3 stones instead!
- `Challenge` your opponent to name any face-down stone.
- `Boast` that you know all the face-down stones for an instant victory!


Use all of these actions to trick your opponent every chance you get. Bluff your way to victory with a boast, or put your enemy on the spot with a challenge! Just try not to forget where everything is yourself!


## THE STONES:
- The Crown
- The Shield
- The Flag
- The Sword
- The Clover
- The World
- The Tome

All of these stones start off the line at the beginning of the game, and any can be placed with the "Place" command. They are all functionally the same, but each have a different piece of art courtesy of Aleksandr Makarov.

I have learned so much throughout this project. I'm so happy with how it went! Thanks for playing!
